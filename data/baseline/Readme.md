# Dataset 

We apply COINS to the NSC and the Story Ending Generation tasks. We construct the NSC dataset on the basis of ROCStories Corpus, which contains 98,162 five-sentence stories with a clear beginning and ending, thus making it a good choice for this task. We choose the first two sentences (s1, s2) as beginning rather than just s1 because the first sentence (s1) tends to be short in lengh, and usually introduces characters or sets the scene whereas the second sentence (s2) provides more information about the initial story.
